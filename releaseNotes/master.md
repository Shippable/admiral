## Release Date

${REL_VER_DATE}

## Features

- **Added `size` column for subscription node pools table**: The [Subscription Node Pools](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/management/subscription/node-pools/) panel in a subscription's "Node Pools" page now shows you a "Size" column if you have any On Demand node pools, making it easier to identify how your node pools have been configured.
- **Drydock update**: Updating all Shippable official images with latest
  stable versions of [languages](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/runtime/machine-image/language-versions/), [cli's](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/runtime/machine-image/cli-versions/) and [services](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/runtime/machine-image/services-versions/). Refer to documentation
  for [v6.9.4](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/runtime/machine-image/ami-v694/) for details.
- **Registered Shippable IRC nicks**: Shippable is now registered on `chat.freenode.net` and `irc.freenode.net`. Open a [support issue](https://github.com/Shippable/support/issues/new) if you would like Shippable to use a registered nick to send IRC messages to another server.
- **New shipctl replicate command**: `shipctl replicate` is now available for copying state resource data. See [documentation](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/tutorial/workflow/using-shipctl/#replicate) for more details.

## Fixes

- **Fixes styling of `h3` elements in changelog**: `h3` headings are now formatted correctly in the changelog.
- **Fixes meta tags in Shippable documentation**: The HTML meta tags for page description in the [Shippable documentation](http://docs.shippable.com/) were malformed. These tags have been fixed.
- **Fixes webhook integrations can't be created as org integrations**: It was not possible to create [Webhook integrations](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/integration/webhook/) as [org integrations](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/tutorial/integration/subscription-integrations/#creating-an-org-integration-recommended-for-teams). This has now been enabled.
- **Fixes deleting a deployed service**: [Deleting deployed services](http://docs.shippable.com/deploy/deleting-a-service/) on an orchestration platform using Shippable Assembly Lines would fail when using an integration in "master" mode. This has now been fixed.
- **Fixes overlap of names in sidebar menu**: Long SCM names would cause an overlap of text in the sidebar menu. This has been fixed with an ellipsis if the text is too long.

## Shippable Server

### Features

- **Configurable IRC nick**: The IRC nick (and optional password) can be configured for individual servers in the Admiral UI on the add-ons tab. A default IRC nick may also be set in the same location by leaving the server field blank.
- **Templates support for runCI**: Now templates support is available for runCI jobs also. A user can define templates in their `shippable.yml` and use them in all of their CI sections in that YML. Also, the user can define a central shippable.templates.yml file and keep all their templates globally. Along with this user can also import external template files defined in some other public repo using its raw file path, and then use templates defined in this file in your jobs by mentioning these external URLs in shippable.templates.yml. [See the docs](http://docs.shippable.com/ci/yml-structure/) for more details.
