# v7.3.1 Release Notes

## Release Date

Thursday, Mar 28 2019

## Features

- **Bitbucket Sync Updated**: We've made some updates to how we synchronize Bitbucket accounts to accommodate the [removal of username from Bitbucket APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/bitbucket-api-changes-gdpr/). Some names displayed may change slightly as the new Bitbucket settings become available.

## Fixes

- **gcloudKey Deployment Errors**: We've fixed an error that occurred when trying to revoke gcloud credentials during managed deploy jobs.
- **SPOG tooltip stickiness**: Tooltips will no longer remain on the page after navigating away and coming back.
