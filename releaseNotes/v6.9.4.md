# v6.9.4 Release Notes

## Release Date

Thursday, Sep 27 2018

## Features

- **Added `size` column for subscription node pools table**: The [Subscription Node Pools](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/management/subscription/node-pools/) panel in a subscription's "Node Pools" page now shows you a "Size" column if you have any On Demand node pools, making it easier to identify how your node pools have been configured.
- **Drydock update**: Updating all Shippable official images with latest
  stable versions of [languages](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/runtime/machine-image/language-versions/), [cli's](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/runtime/machine-image/cli-versions/) and [services](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/runtime/machine-image/services-versions/). Refer to documentation
  for [v6.9.4](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/runtime/machine-image/ami-v694/) for details.
- **Registered Shippable IRC nicks**: Shippable is now registered on `chat.freenode.net` and `irc.freenode.net`. Open a [support issue](https://github.com/Shippable/support/issues/new) if you would like Shippable to use a registered nick to send IRC messages to another server.
- **New shipctl replicate command**: `shipctl replicate` is now available for copying state resource data. See [documentation](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/tutorial/workflow/using-shipctl/#replicate) for more details.

## Fixes

- **Fixes styling of `h3` elements in changelog**: `h3` headings are now formatted correctly in the changelog.
- **Fixes meta tags in Shippable documentation**: The HTML meta tags for page description in the [Shippable documentation](http://docs.shippable.com/) were malformed. These tags have been fixed.
- **Fixes webhook integrations can't be created as org integrations**: It was not possible to create [Webhook integrations](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/integration/webhook/) as [org integrations](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/tutorial/integration/subscription-integrations/#creating-an-org-integration-recommended-for-teams). This has now been enabled.
- **Fixes deleting a deployed service**: [Deleting deployed services](http://docs.shippable.com/deploy/deleting-a-service/) on an orchestration platform using Shippable Assembly Lines would fail when using an integration in "master" mode. This has now been fixed.
- **Fixes overlap of names in sidebar menu**: Long SCM names would cause an overlap of text in the sidebar menu. This has been fixed with an ellipsis if the text is too long.
- **YML templates support for CI**: YML templates can now be used in CI jobs. You can define reusable templates directly within your `shippable.yml`, or define them in a `shippable.templates.yml` file at the root of your repository and refer to them in your `shippable.yml`. You can also define your templates externally and import them with a URL. [See the docs](http://docs.shippable.com/ci/yml-structure/#yml-templates) for more details.
- **Fixes java version when using shipctl**: `shipctl jdk set` was not correctly setting the `JAVA_HOME` variable, which caused problems with some services that rely on this.  Now, to switch between Java versions inside your script, use `source shipctl jdk set <version>`. This will ensure that the ENVs are set at the appropriate level.  [See the docs](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/tutorial/workflow/using-shipctl/#jdk-set) for examples.

## Shippable Server

### Features

- **Configurable IRC nick**: The IRC nick (and optional password) can be configured for individual servers in the Admiral UI on the add-ons tab. A default IRC nick may also be set in the same location by leaving the server field blank.

- **Tag and Comment build support for Gerrit**: Gerrit projects and gitRepo resources can now be configured to trigger builds on tag and comment events. See [gitRepo](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/workflow/resource/gitrepo/#latestSyntax) and [Project Settings](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/management/project/settings/#webhookConfig) documentation for more details.
